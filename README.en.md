These are AI Skills I've been using in my own projects. They've proven useful, so I'm open-sourcing them.

Each Skill here is a structured instruction set that Agents can load directly, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Works with Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes.
